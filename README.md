## QRCODE GENERATOR FRONTEND

#### Project details and some notes
<span>project made in Next.js, a React.js framework widely used for SEO, Performance and other benefits. The application is simple, with a minimum of dependencies. In the project I used some React hooks. I decided not to add things that I don't need but that I think it's important to say that I know how to use: ContextAPI, Hooks, Routes, Performance, other hooks like UseRef, useReducer, useMemo, useCallback...</span>
<br/>
<span>The project has mandatory field locks, validation if the links are really valid and also it is not possible to create a page if the 'slug' already exists</span>
